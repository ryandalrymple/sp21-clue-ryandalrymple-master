Random Strategy:

How often do you get a solution in fewer than 20 guesses? Does this change depending on the theory you test (1, 2, 3)?

Not very often, I would say maybe ~15% if I had to put a guess on it. This is consistent throughout the theories tested.

What is good or bad about this strategy?

This strategy relies on a random number generator to match with another random number generator. Statistically it is unlikely that the numbers will match, which is why it is seldom under 20 guesses.


Iterative Strategy

How often do you get a solution in fewer than 20 guesses? Does this change depending on the theory you test (1, 2, 3)?

The solution is always 20 guesses or fewer. Yes, because I wrote it to start at 1, it guesses the first theory correct on the first time, the second one correct after 20 tries, 0 < theory 3 < 20 for the last one

What is good or bad about this strategy?

The good: This is the simpliest solution to this problem where you will always meet the requirements (that I can think of!)
The bad: This is very unlikely to be the fastest way to solve this problem. There must be another solution that will reduce the average number of iterations for all three.
